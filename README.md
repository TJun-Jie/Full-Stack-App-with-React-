# Full-Stack-App-with-React-

This is an app to manage a hypothetical school's course data. All users can view courses and create a user profile to create courses, update their courses and delete courses. 
User login is persisted with cookies and authentication protects private routes.
In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.

The app is built using REST API and React.
